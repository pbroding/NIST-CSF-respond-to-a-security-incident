<h2>NIST CSF Respond to a Security Incident</h2>
<h4>Welcome to my cybersecurity lab, a journey that sheds light on the practical applications of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cyber Security Framework. In this project, I've meticulously explored the adaptability and utility of the NIST CSF in diverse cybersecurity scenarios.</h4>

<h4>The NIST CSF is recognized worldwide for its role in shaping robust cybersecurity practices. Understanding how to apply it effectively is essential in modern cybersecurity. This lab project serves as a testament to the framework's versatility and its potential to address a variety of security challenges.</h4>

<h4>Two Convenient Formats: To make this knowledge readily available, I've provided the lab report in both Microsoft Word and PDF formats. This flexibility allows you to choose the medium that suits your preferences and enhances your learning experience.</h4>
